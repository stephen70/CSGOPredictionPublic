Balance dataset to 50/50 win rate for team1.

Boxplots of all features

Normalise map component to average rwp of team, to remove its relation to how good a team is

Nicefy github

Remove samples with only few maps played

Change app from iterating through filtered matches to unparsed matches.

Add new features:
Easy:
BO1/3/5 dummy variables.
rad/comp for last 5/10 and 20 days/maps and COs
Add H2H. Curb no H2H matches by time discounting and dropping NA.
Average rwp at halftime for last 5/10 and 20 days/maps and COs.
Start side dummy variable.
Percentage of rounds won as T/CT for last 5/10 and 20 days/maps and COs.
Map and interaction term for map/start side
RWP for games starting as T/CT for last 5/10 and 20 days/maps and COs.
Interaction term between start side and rwp for games starting as t/ct for last 5/10 and 20 days/maps and COs.
Change in ranking points over last 20/40/60 days.
Hard:
Add average player age.
Scrape and add betting odds features, see ML tennis paper. They use max odds/average odds/bet365 odds.
Time since roster change, shouldn't be hard to scrape with only top30. If this is too awkward, simply put in days since a team's creation.
Clutches for last 5/10 and 20 days/maps and COs
Pistols won for last 5/10 and 20 days/maps and COs
rwp after 5/10/15/20/25 rounds in for last 5/10 and 20 days/maps and COs
Map correlation as in tennis ML paper

Then create interaction terms and STDs.

Feature selection:
Hyperparameter search by greedy algorithm, using accuracy instead of spearman
