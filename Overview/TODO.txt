Add HLTV rank difference, likely good predictor
- Scrape ranked team ids and points
- Allow lookup of team's points from id
- Drop any teams that are not in top X at time of match

Add comments

Add average rating STD - perhaps teams with a star player perform worse than equally skilled teams

Readme in directories to explain

Remove H2H

Make CO feature use rounds won instead of matches won

Grid search for best parameters to optimize Spearman, when above are complete

Jupyter notebook for feature selection

Rename columns at start of 1Matches file

Rename W/L to rwp

Split fatigue into rounds played in the last few days (fat), and appearances on hltv (app), the number of matches played on hltv in the last 60 days or so

Can last match be improved? Was it never significant?

Consider adding back colinear features later (ARD, Rod/Comp, etc). Colinearity is OK in most models (RFs, SVMs), but check that the predictions don't vary wildly with different folds in CV.

Calculate STDs for features, compSTD is good

All time decays removed, consider adding in later

Comment code excessively

Test corw for bugs, disappointing predictive power
