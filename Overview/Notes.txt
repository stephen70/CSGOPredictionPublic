No time discounting used to simplify. Could consider using this in final version. ML tennis paper found it did not have a very large effect.

Consider adding back colinear features later (ARD, Rod/Comp, etc). Colinearity is OK in most models (RFs, SVMs), but check that the predictions don't vary wildly with different folds in CV.

Comment code excessively.

Time discounting to app would improve it?
