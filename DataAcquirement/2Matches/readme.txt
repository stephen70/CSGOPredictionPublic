Scrapes match and player data from HLTV, then removes samples with missing values/no player stats/no common opponents. Produces matches.csv which is used for creating features. Sometimes matchresultsunparsed is used in order to account for matches that themselves didn't make it into matches.csv.
Be careful of dependency of run order, playersParser drops matches which aren't in matches.csv, so run it after matchesParser
