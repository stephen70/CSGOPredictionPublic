# Sports Prediction for CS:GO

An attempt at predicting match winners for the team-based game CS:GO using various machine learning/statistical learning methods, including linear regression, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, random forests and neural networks. A re-write to fix bugs and increase efficiency is currently underway. Using only a few features and with no parameter tuning, classification accuracy is at 61%.

All database files used have been removed for the public version, as HLTV forbids re-hosting of their (hard-earned) data.
