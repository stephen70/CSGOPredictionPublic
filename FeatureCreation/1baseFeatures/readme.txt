rad double counted matches due to a matchID search of players.csv returning the entire match, not just a single map. combatting this by dropping a result if it is exactly the same as the previous one. can be properly fixed by comparing maps
Currently corw is against COs, but other features like rad and radstd are only against recent matches. should try including co and non-co versions of each feature and test predictive power
Tried calculating fatigue for small span (5 days), not significant. Removing and only using long term fatigue (and renaming it app, for number of appearances on HLTV)
Consider dropping early samples, as don't have correct app feature
Fat is calculated from the parsed matchResults, which is much smaller than the unparsed version. Could consider using unparsed version, could make a difference.
